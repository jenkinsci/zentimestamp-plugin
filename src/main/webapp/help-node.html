    <p>
        The Jenkins BUILD_ID variable uses by default the date and time 'YYYY-MM-DD_hh-mm-ss' of the international
        standard.<br/>
        You can change this format by providing your own pattern for all jobs on this node. <br/>
        You always are able to override the date pattern in your job.
